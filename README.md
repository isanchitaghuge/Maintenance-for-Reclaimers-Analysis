# Maintenance-for-Reclaimers-Analysis

## These machines run literally round the clock 24/7 for 365 days a year. Every minute of downtime equates to millions of dollars lost revenue, that is why it is crucial to identify exactly when these machines require maintenance. A reclaimer machine requires maintenance when within the previous month there was at least one 8-hour period when the average idle capacity was over 10%.
